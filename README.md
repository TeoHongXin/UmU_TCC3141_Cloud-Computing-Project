Cloud Computing Project
=======================

Steps taken to implement the app:
- We first had a meeting with all members to discuss and draft out the design and functions for our app. Next, we all choose which app inventor to use for creating our app. Out of all app inventors, our team decided to use MIT App Inventor. In MIT App Inventor, we use blocks to do the functions for our app. We also discuss with each other on which cloud databese to use. After discussing with all the members, we decided to use Firebase as our cloud database. Once the app is completed, we do some testing by using MIT AI2 Companion or download the .apk file  to our mobile devices to check if the app works.
